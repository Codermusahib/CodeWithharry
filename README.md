The purpose of this project is to showcase proficiency in front-end web development by cloning an existing website. By recreating the Code with Harry website, I aimed to demonstrate my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my ability to replicate complex layouts and designs. This project serves as both a learning exercise and a portfolio piece, highlighting my dedication to mastering web development technologies and delivering high-quality projects.
